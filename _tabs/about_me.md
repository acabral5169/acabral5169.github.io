# Hi!

My name is Angel, and I am a Grad student at SDSU finishing up an MS in Applied Math. This web page is to help guide whoever see what projects and jobs I've done.

In addition to getting a Master's in Applied Mathematics, I also completed my undergrad at UCSD in Structural Engineering, with a focus in Aerospace in June of 2020. During my time at school, I have been apart of many projects and clubs, including the UCSD PepBand. I played trumpet and became conductor for a bit, playing for all types of school and athletic events. It aligned with my love for music and sports. 

Outside of my schooling years, I have also been apart of other minor and important jobs. After graduating from UCSD, I was hired for a full time roll as a Project Engineer for a construction management company, RGMK, based in San Jose. I learned a lot of hands on skills and dealt with a lot of people who didn't like doing their job. The job dealt with high demands and time-important deadlines, but also lead me to work in some great locations - Monterey being a favorite.

My studies at SDSU began in August of 2024. As great as this job had to offer, I wanted more and decided to challenge myself with getting a higher degree. Math, learning, and problem-solving are all things I love, in addition to the people I love, who mostly live in San Diego.

Outisde work and family, I love sports - the competition and story behind any game or player, playing or watching, and with baseball being my favorite; I love music - playing the trumpet, would love to learn piano, and listening to any Elvis album; and I love good food - I know I should visit Kansas or Tennesse, but Texas BBQ has been the best BBQ I've had so far. I also love it when hard work pays off, and completing a project you can be proud of. 

If you have any questions, or would like to reach out for more information, please do not hesitate. If reaching out by phone, please leave a voice-mail or text message so I know who and what it is you are calling about. Thank you!
