# Dengue Research at SDSU
$\bf Project Year:$ 2025-2026 \
$\bf Skills:$ Python

During my time at SDSU, I worked with Dr. Naveen Vaidya to mathematically model the mosquito-borne disease, Dengue, in the country Nepal under spatio-temporal temperature constraints. Dengue is a severe disease if not correctly treated, and especially important to a resource-defficient country such as Nepal. My research was unique in that I used partial differential equations and the programming tool, Python, in order to estimate the infected population over time according to real, experimental data and assumed initial conditions.
